# Project-Sloth's FiveM Inventory System

Reskinned by @Brotatochips11 - Discord: brotatochips11

## Overview

Project-Sloth's FiveM Inventory System is a complete redesign aimed to mimic the look and feel of the NoPixel 4.0 inventory system. This redesign enhances the user experience by offering a clean, intuitive interface while maintaining the core functionalities we've come to appreciate in the original lj-inventory system.

### Note
I removed the item images for simplicity during the update process. Please use your own item images to match the aesthetic and functionality of your server.
